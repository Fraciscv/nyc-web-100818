Review!
=======

## Objectives

* Answer questions
* Draw out code flow charts
* Look at READMEs / Deliverables / Test Messages / Errors

* Classes
  * create a container, so we can isolate code
  * the data inside of it, instance variables, are unique to that instance
  * makes things more robust than just random Strings, Hashes, data that we cobble togethger
  * create reusable code
  * model things in the real world so they can interact with each other
  * with instance variables, we don't ahve to pass arguements to every method because the instance has the variable stored within it
  * create a container so if you have a program, you can break it up into certain parts, so if you change things, communication is separate
  * makes it more robvust cause classes can reference one another rather than just Strings
  * create reusable code
  * Model a real life thing, so you create a class so these real life things can interact with each other
* Instantiates
  * run when we do .new


* READING THE SPEC!!
* how to create your own tests  
  * belongs to
  * has many => how to connect the classes, join table
  * way that objects talk to each other
