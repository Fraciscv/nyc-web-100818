## How to Clone the Lecture Code:

- Clone the repo on your machine and put it in a folder called `lecture-code`:
  - `$ git clone git@github.com:learn-co-students/nyc-web-100818.git lecture-code`

- Anytime the code is updated: `$ git pull`. **IF YOU CANNOT MERGE IN THE CHANGES** `$ git reset --hard`. This will reset the repo to the last commit you have on your machine. If you make changes to the code, you will not be able to pull down the changes. Resetting back to the last commit will allow you to pull down the new code without any conflicts.
